		Set a log level - messages with severity level lower than this setting 
		will not be recorded. The list of levels in descending order is 
		following:
		
		SEVERE
		WARNING
		INFO
		CONFIG
		FINE
		FINER
		FINEST
		
		It corresponds with the levels used by class java.util.logging.Logger,
		which the Vicinity Gateway utilizes for event logging. This value can also
		be set to OFF, which will disable the logging mechanism completely. 
		-->
		<level>FINEST</level>
		
		<!-- 
		Setting this value to 'true' will cause the application to log its output
		to console, aside from logging it into file. This can be useful when 
		debugging the software. 
		
		Setting it to 'false' will suppress this behavior, instead logging 
		events solely to log file. This is the default behavior.

		Setting this parameter to true will enable security. The policy is to
		try the strongest mechanisms first. Not having a valid certificate 
		on server will always fail the connection.
		
		Setting it to false will disable the security all together (not 
		recommended, only for debug purposes). Connecting to a server that 
		accepts only TLS will fail the connection. Default is true.
