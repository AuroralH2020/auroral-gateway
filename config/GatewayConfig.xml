		<!-- 
		Set a relative or absolute (recommended) path to log file. 
		In order to differentiate among multiple log files, a '%s' can be added
		to arbitrary location in the string, which will be replaced by a time
		stamp during start. Each start of the Gateway will produce a new log file
		with a new time stamp.

		<!--
		Set a log level - messages with severity level lower than this setting 
		will not be recorded. The list of levels in descending order is 
		following:
		
		SEVERE
		WARNING
		INFO
		CONFIG
		FINE
		FINER
		FINEST
		
		It corresponds with the levels used by class java.util.logging.Logger,
		which the Vicinity Gateway utilizes for event logging. This value can also
		be set to OFF, which will disable the logging mechanism completely. 
		-->
		<level>FINEST</level>
		
		<!-- 
		Setting this value to 'true' will cause the application to log its output
		to console, aside from logging it into file. This can be useful when 
		debugging the software. 
		
		Setting it to 'false' will suppress this behaviour, instead logging 
		events solely to log file. This is the default behaviour.

		URL/IP address of XMPP server. If not set, the application exits.

		<!--
		Defaults to 5222 if not set. Server port uses STARTTLS.
		-->
		<port>5222</port>
		
		<!-- 
		Setting this parameter to true will enable encryption of communication. The policy is to
		try the strongest mechanisms first. Not having a valid certificate 
		on server will always fail the connection.
		
		Setting it to false will disable the security all together (not 
		recommended, only for debug purposes). Connecting to a server that 
		accepts only TLS will fail the connection. Default is true.  
		-->
		<security>false</security>

		XMPP domain that is served by the server. Defaults to vicinity.eu.
		-->
		<domain>vicinity.eu</domain>
		
		<!--
		Enables debugging of the XMPP communication between the Gateway and the
		server / other Gateways. Note that this is to be used in conjunction
		with the SMACK debugger, which is external tool.
		See http://download.igniterealtime.org/smack/docs/latest/documentation/debugging.html.
		
		Default is false.

		<!--
		Number of seconds to consider request message as no longer relevant. 
		After a request is sent from point A to point B, point A waits for 
		response. If the response does not arrive until this timeout expires, 
		point B is considered unreachable. If the response arrives after this
		happens, the response is ignored and discarded and a new request has
		to be sent.
		
		Default is 30 seconds.

	<api>
		<!--
		Set the port on which the API will be served. If not explicitly set, 
		it defaults to 8181. Be aware that running the software on privileged
		ports (<1024) needs root's privileges. 
		-->
		<port>8181</port>
		
		<!--
		Set whether the API will be served via HTTP or HTTPS. Takes either true
		or false value. Default is true, however in some installations it might
		not be supported.

		<!--
		Authentication realm for the RESTLET BEARER authentication schema. It 
		is only taken into account if the authMethod is set to bearer.
		
		Defaults to vicinity.eu.
		-->
		<authRealm>vicinity.eu</authRealm>
		
		<!--
		Authentication method for objects logging into the Gateway API. Following
		methods are valid:
		
		basic	-	Basic HTTP authentication standard.
		
		digest	-	Digest HTTP authentication standard.
		
		bearer	-	Token authentication (JWT/OAuth)
		
		none	-	No authentication. Experimental, for debugging purposes only.
					Without authentication, there is no way of logging into the
					network other than hard coded credentials (or other
					kind of customization).
		
		Defaults to basic.

		If the agent listens on a different interface (or a different machine),
