		SEVERE
		WARNING
		INFO
		CONFIG
		FINE
		FINER
		FINEST

		be set to OFF, which will disable the logging mechanism completely.

		Setting this value to 'true' will cause the application to log its output
		to console, aside from logging it into file. This can be useful when 
		debugging the software. 
		
		Setting it to 'false' will suppress this behavior, instead logging 
		events solely to log file. This is the default behavior.
