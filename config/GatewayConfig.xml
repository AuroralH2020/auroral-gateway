		Set a log level - messages with severity level lower than this setting 
		will not be recorded. The list of levels in descending order is 
		following:
		
		SEVERE
		WARNING
		INFO
		CONFIG
		FINE
		FINER
		FINEST
		
		It corresponds with the levels used by class java.util.logging.Logger,
		which the Vicinity Gateway utilizes for event logging. This value can also
		be set to OFF, which will disable the logging mechanism completely.

		<!-- 
		Setting this value to 'true' will cause the application to log its output
		to console, aside from logging it into file. This can be useful when 
		debugging the software. 
		
		Setting it to 'false' will suppress this behavior, instead logging 
		events solely to log file. This is the default behavior.

		none	-	No authentication. Experimental, for debugging purposes only.
					Without authentication, there is no way of logging into the
					XMPP network other than hard coded credentials (or other
